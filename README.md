# Hey, I'm Saurabh! 🚀

**Building for India 🇮🇳 | 9+ Years on GitHub | 100+ Repositories**

I'm a full-stack security engineer and AI tinkerer with a passion for solving real-world problems through technology. Over the past 9+ years and 100+ repositories, I've gone from building network security tools to creating offline-first mobile apps and integrating AI into everything in between.

- **eBPF** for security innovations and performance monitoring - diving deep into kernel-level observability
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** to level up my API game and build more scalable backends
- **On-device LLM integrations** to make AI more accessible and private, especially for offline-first apps
- **RAG systems** for practical AI applications that solve real problems (like insurance comparison)

## 💡 What Makes Me Different

- 🌉 **Bridge builder**: I connect traditional enterprise solutions with modern AI capabilities - like turning 8,500+ insurance products into an AI-powered comparison tool
- 📴 **Offline-first mindset**: Building for India's connectivity realities with apps that work completely offline (Handy, marauders-money-rn)
- 🔓 **Active open-source contributor**: 100+ personal repositories plus contributions to 4+ organizations (DvaitaTech, AllComplement, afrost-org, fossevents) and major security tools (OWASP, RustScan, mitmproxy)
- 🤝 **Community builder**: Active in FOSS community initiatives through afrost-org (14 commits to afrost.org) and fossevents organizations
- 🔧 **Hardware tinkerer**: Love working with Raspberry Pi to create compact, efficient solutions that bridge software and physical computing
- 🇮🇳 **India-forward**: Focused on solving problems specific to the Indian market - from insurance complexity to logistics tracking, railway PNR notifications, and courier tracking
